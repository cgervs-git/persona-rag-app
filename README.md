# ðŸ¤– Persona-Based RAG App for Technical Document Understanding

This is a prototype web application that allows semiconductor professionals to ask personalized questions about technical PDF documents. It uses **OpenAI's GPT-4**, **embeddings**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to generate answers that are tailored to different industry roles, such as IDM engineers, fabless chip designers, and product manufacturers.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Accepts one or more **technical PDF documents** as input
- Extracts and embeds content using `text-embedding-ada-002`
- Stores embeddings in a local **FAISS vector index**
- Lets users select a **persona** (e.g. IDM, Foundry, Fabless, OEM)
- Uses **semantic search + GPT-4** to answer questions from that personaâ€™s point of view

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Itâ€™s Useful

Different roles in the semiconductor industry care about different aspects of the same technical content.  
This tool allows users to:

- Get quick, context-aware insights from documents
- View supporting passages pulled from relevant PDF sections
- Understand complex content through the lens of their own role
